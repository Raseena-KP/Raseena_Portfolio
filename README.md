#Project 1: Air Quality Prediction: Project Overview
•	Created a tool to predict Temperature in polluted area
•	Data contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city
• Analyzed the contribution of each chemical to the increase in temperature
•	Feature selection done using Lasso Regularizations and Tree based algorithm
•	Compared Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor to reach the best model
