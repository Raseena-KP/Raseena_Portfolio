# [Project 1: Air Quality Prediction: Project Overview ](https://github.com/Raseena-KP/Air-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/Predicting_Air_Quality.ipynb)
-	Created a tool to predict Temperature in polluted area</br>
-	Data contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city</br>
-	Analyzed the contribution of each chemical to the increase in temperature</br>
-	Feature selection done using Lasso Regularizations and Tree based algorithm</br>
-	Compared Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor to reach the best model</br>

# [Project 2: Customer Segmentation : Project Overview ](https://github.com/Raseena-KP/Customer_Segmentation/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)
-	Analyzed and segmented customers based on their purchase behavior</br>
-	Used transactional data from an online retailer based in the UK</br>
-	Engineered features from historical data</br>
-	Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method</br>
-	Performed segmentation using the K-Means algorithm</br>
-	Evaluated the model's performance using the Silhouette score</br>
-	Identified three distinct customer segments: low-value customers, high-value customers, and bulk customers</br>
