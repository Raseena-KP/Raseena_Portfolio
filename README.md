# [Project 1: Air Quality Prediction: Project Overview ](https://github.com/Raseena-KP/Air-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/Predicting_Air_Quality.ipynb)
•	Created a tool to predict Temperature in polluted area
•	Data contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city
• Analyzed the contribution of each chemical to the increase in temperature
•	Feature selection done using Lasso Regularizations and Tree based algorithm
•	Compared Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor to reach the best model
